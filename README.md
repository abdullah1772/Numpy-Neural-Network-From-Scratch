# Numpy-Neural-Network-From-Scratch

Dataset
The MNIST database of handwritten digits. It has a training set of 60,000 images, and a test set of 10,000 images.  The dataset consists of 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.

This code contains a neural network made from scracth using numpy only.
This neural network uses 3 activation fuctions Relu, Sigmoid and Softmax.
The optimizer used in this code is SGD.
Early stopping conditions are implemented in the code as well.
